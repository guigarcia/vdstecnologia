- **Icons**: Lucide React
- **AI Tools**: Claude, GPT-4, Cursor, GitHub Copilot
- **Cloud**: AWS, Azure, GCP, Snowflake

## 🎨 Design Philosophy

- **Cyberpunk Minimalism**: Dark, clean, with neon accents
- **Terminal Aesthetic**: Because we're developers for developers
- **Performance First**: 60fps animations, optimized assets
- **Mobile Ready**: Responsive from 320px to 4K
