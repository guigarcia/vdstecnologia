  We're a team of senior developers who embraced AI

  Fun fact: This entire site was built using:
  - Cursor IDE (our favorite toy)
  - Claude & GPT-4 (our AI partners)
  - Next.js 15 + TypeScript (our weapons of choice)
  - Pure CSS (no frameworks, just skill)
  - Lots of coffee ☕ (the real MVP)

  Standards: HTML5, CSS3, ES2024
  Components: React 19, Next.js 15
  Language: TypeScript (because types save lives)
  IDE: Cursor (heavy users, proud of it)
  AI: Claude, GPT-4, Gemini, DeepSeek
  
/* TECH PHILOSOPHY */

  1. Value First - Always start with business impact
  2. Velocity with Control - Fast but not reckless  
  3. Validated Delivery - Test everything
  4. Secure by Design - No shortcuts on security
  5. Scale Ready - Think big from day one
  6. VDS Framework - Our secret sauce

  - Values clean architecture
